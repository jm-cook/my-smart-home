This wall panel is made from a 7" Huawei Media Pad T3. It has a resolution of 1024x600, its quite small, and a few years old, but it does work as an excellent display in the kitchen area. 
The compact display is designed to be easy to read from a distance, and just shows the essential sensor values that I am most interested in. The panel is at our holiday cottage, which is in a remote location with no road. There 
is electricity, but no mains water, however it can still be smart!

The essential components are a date/time card, a thermostat card for the living room, the outdoor temperature, the hot tub temperature, and the state of the borehole, with a few essential bits of information along the bottom.
Most of the cards use [mushroom cards](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom), but with some changes to the default theme so that I can see them clearly when standing a short distance away.
